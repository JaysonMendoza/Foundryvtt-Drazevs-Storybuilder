# Foundryvtt-Drazevs-storybuilder
This is a module for FoundryVTT that provides a dynamic way for players and game masters to build a story together. It uses the idea of events and states to help track the decisions of the adventuring party and their impact on the game world. View historical events in their chronicle as a timeline or plan future ones and track world effects.
